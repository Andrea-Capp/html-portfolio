    <h1>The best movies according to Andrea</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
    <hr>
    <!--primo film-->
    <h3>Joker</h3>
    <p>This is the last film I saw. Really amazing, I found mainly interesting the psychological aspect of the protagonist.</p>
    <!--secondo film-->
    <h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
    <p>This movie blowed up my mind. Very accurate descriptions, well structured and it has a complete story on the atomic bomb with flashbacks every now and then.</p>
    <!--terzo film-->
    <h3>Bad boys</h3>
    <p>I like so much Will Smith and his comedy, so I have to mention it. There's lot of actions, shootings and wrong phrases at the wrong time every moment that they requires. Must see.</p>
